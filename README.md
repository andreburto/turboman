# Turboman App

## About

The app: http://turboman.mothersect.info/

In December every year I take a picture of my [Turboman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116705/) action figure in front of a picture of my Turboman action figure. This app is a way for me to easily browse through those pictures.

It's also a good way for me to experiment with Cypress tests (eventually) and Terraform deployments.

## Deploy

### Requirements

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), `npm`, and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed.

### Steps to Deploy

1. Change to the project root.
2. Run `npm run deploy`.
